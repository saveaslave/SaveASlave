If the row is white, it will appear on the site. &nbsp;Notice that the links have a page assigned to them (see the &quot;PAGE&quot; column). If the link background on the admin page is white, when you visit the page specified, you will see the link there.</p>

					Manage Countries</h3>

				<p>

					The <a href="http://www.saveaslave.com/managecountry.php" target="_blank">Manage Country</a> page allows you to add/edit country page content. After first logging in, you can choose to add a new country page, by clicking &quot;New Country Page&quot;. View or Manage an existing country page, by selecting the country name from the indicated drop-downs. For example, to manage a country page, you would choose the country name from the drop-down on the right. The language the page is in is indicated using the universal language identifier. For example [en] for English, or [es] for Spanish.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;">

					<img alt="" src="http://www.saveaslave.com/images/help/help_managecountry_choices.jpg" style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 1px;" /></p>

				<p>

					If you choose a new country page, it will load the empty country template. You can enter the information for the country. For some fields, if you leave them empty it will automatically insert default text/pictures. These fields are labeled &quot;Leave blank for default&quot;. &nbsp;Some fields are required, like Language and Country Name. The language the page is in is specified using the universal language identifier. For example [en] for English, [es] for Spanish or [fr] for French. When creating a new country, if the country name in another language matches the country name in English for an existing page, it will automatically use the English Flag, Map and Picture image files.</p>

				<p>

					If you choose to manage an existing country, it will load with all of the existing content in the fields, which you can edit. One of the most valuable contribution volunteers can make towards the country pages is to expand the country descriptions. You could potentially use <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for source information. Remember to click the &quot;Submit&quot; button to save your changes.</p>

					Manage Volunteers</h3>

				<p>

					The <a href="http://www.saveaslave.com/managevolunteer.php" target="_blank">Manage Volunteers</a> page will allow you to view/create/remove/modify user accounts for site volunteers. To create a new user, click the &quot;New User&quot; link at the top of the page. It will open the blank user form to create a new volunteer for the system.</p>

				<p>

					At the bottom of the screen, you can see a list of all users, and other helpful information related to them. For example, their username, name, email, preference for giving credit, page permissions, who created or removed the account and when it was created or removed.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;">

					<img alt="" src="http://www.saveaslave.com/images/help/help_managevolunteer_list.jpg" style="text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 1px; width: 725px;" /></p>

				<p>

					If you click the ID, in the left column beside the name, it will open the user in the form to edit their settings. You cannot change the ID field. The &quot;Give Credit&quot; field controls the display of the user&#39;s name on the website as having been the last person to update the page. If &quot;Give Credit&quot; is set to &quot;No&quot; their name will not appear on the website. You can specify the &quot;Page Permissions&quot; the user has access to. Just put a check to the left of each page name that the user should have access to. &nbsp;If you are editing a user and wish to remove access to a specific management activity, just uncheck the box next to the activity. If a volunteer should no longer have access to the site, set &quot;Removed&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot; and they will no longer be able to log in and manage the system.</p>
