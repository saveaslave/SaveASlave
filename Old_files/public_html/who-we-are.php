</p><p>The world ignores millions of slaves trapped in
involuntary labor and prostitution. There might be approximately 19,000 trafficked persons right here in the United States.

Those poor unfortunates, Trafficked migrants already here in the United States are not physically chained but never the less are living and working under 
constant fear of harm or harm to their family back home.

</p><p>These people of all ages and sexes are suffering
criminal abuse.

<p>Because some people make a profit or living of the backs of these poor people, helping to free slaves might be dangerous. Because of this potential 
danger, be careful. A relationship might degenerate. Under certain circumstances your actions can be interpreted as solicitation for prostitution. Be careful 
and be safe.

</p> <p>If you know of anything about a recently freed slave in need of a home or care. Please help any way that you can legally, morally and ethically are able to.

</p><p>Please do whatever that you can, that is safe, tasteful and ethical as often as you can, as much as you can to help this cause.         

</p><p>Whatever you post online is forever, so be careful.

There is no lawyer here and no legal advice will be given out. Nobody can be aware of thousands of laws, rules and regulations which are administered and 
enforced by different federal departments and agencies. Every country, state or territory has its laws, rules and regulations also.

</p> <hr class="style11">	<p>Trafficking in persons, particularly women and children, is significant on nearly every continent. Gauging the level of trafficking with precision, however, is 
difficult since it is an underground industry. Estimates of the trafficking problem in the United States vary, given differing definitions of what constitutes 
trafficking and research based on limited case studies. At present, no one US or international agency is compiling accurate statistics. Nonetheless, 
government and nongovernmental experts in the field estimate that out of the 700,000 to two million women and children who are trafficked globally each 
year, 45,000 to 50,000 of those women and children are trafficked to the United States. Approximately 30,000 women and children are being trafficked 
annually from Southeast Asia, 10,000 from Latin America, 4,000 from the Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe, and 1,000 from other regions. 
There have been reports of trafficking instances in at least 20 different states, with most cases occurring in New York, California, and Florida. Some 
Florida law enforcement officials, for example, claim that the state is being inundated with trafficked women from Russia, Ukraine, and Central Europe. INS 
and Labor Department officials fear that the problem is not only bigger than they thought but also getting worse. For example, INS has discovered over 250 
brothels in 26 different cities, 6 which likely involved trafficking victims. Evidence suggests that state and local law enforcement officials appear to have only 
scratched the surface of the problem. Trafficking cases are hard to uncover as the crime usually occurs behind closed doors, and language and cultural 
barriers usually isolate the victims.

</p> <hr class="style11">	<p>The primary source countries for the United States appear to be Thailand, Vietnam, China, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic. Women 
have also been trafficked to the US from the Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Latvia, Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Honduras among other countries. Women 
have been trafficked to the US primarily for the sex industry (prostitution, stripping, peep and touch shows, and massage parlors that offer a variety of 
sexual services), sweatshop labor, domestic servitude, and agricultural work.
